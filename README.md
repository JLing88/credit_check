# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
I'm proud that I'm able to remember some of the programming principles I learned in school and apply those to Ruby.
1. What do you need to improve?
I definitely need to improve on pseudocoding problems. I tend to just start writing code and then find that I've missed steps. I also need to improve on time management and working on exercises.
1. What questions do you still have?
No questions, just looking forward to learning more about enums, etc.

# Rubric

## Functionality

Notes:

- [4] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics

Notes:

The student(s):

- [4] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [3] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [3] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [3] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [3] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes:

The student(s):

- [3] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [3] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [2] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [3] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing

Notes:

The student(s):

- [3] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [3] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [3] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [3] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass NOTE: We didn't learn about testing until the functionality was already in place, so it was impossible to do on this project.
- [3] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes:

The student(s):

- [3] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [3] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [2] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
